Ella dear,
how was your night, I hope you slept well.
What I'm about to show you is how to create an admin for the software, so you can create a poll and add a judge to that poll.
I'm using this because, I can't upload the video i made, it's almost 1GB and I'm pretty sure my sub will run out as soon as i send 3 
videos.

So write down the steps

before you do this "python manage.py runserver" do this

1. python manage.py createsuperuser
2. enter username
3. enter email
4. enter password
5. confirm password

congrats! you've created an admin, but pls remember the details
6. type => python manage.py runserver
7. goto http://localhost:8000/root/admin/ on your browser (pls do it on a private session)
8. login using the admin details you created
